    In this first step you choose if you want to create a landscape or portrait template and if you want 
    to start with a fully blank template or a pre-made template that you can edit. Select an option by 
    clicking on the dot and selecting 'confirm'.`,

    the type of item you want to add and in the second column the options will appear. You can then drag the 
    element from the second column into your canvas. You can fill in a name of your template above your canvas 
    and right at the bottom you can go back to the first step, save your template or delete your creation (and 
    start over if wanted). You can put mouse on every functionality/item to see an explanation what it is.`
